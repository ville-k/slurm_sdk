# Tutorials

Learn the SDK by running real examples end-to-end. Each tutorial ends with a
command you can execute against your Slurm cluster.

## Getting started

Start here if you're new to the SDK:

- [Getting Started: Hello World](getting_started_hello_world.md) - Submit your
  first Slurm job
- [Container Basics](container_basics_hello_container.md) - Package tasks in
  containers

## GPU and PyTorch

Run GPU-accelerated workloads:

- [PyTorch Hello World](hello_torch.md) - Detect and use GPUs in containers

## Parallel processing

Scale your workloads across nodes:

- [Map-Reduce Pattern](map_reduce.md) - Process data in parallel with array jobs
- [Parallelization Patterns](parallelization_patterns.md) - Fan-out/fan-in,
  pipelines, and parameter sweeps

## Workflows and orchestration

Build complex multi-stage pipelines:

- [Workflow Graph Visualization](workflow_graph_visualization.md) - Track and
  visualize workflow structure
- [Parallel Train + Eval Workflow](parallel-train-eval-workflow.md) - Production-
  style training with checkpoints
